### Language dependencies
We use [asdf][asdf] for managing language dependencies for this project. If you want to use it / check it out, [here are their getting started docs][asdf-setup]. With `asdf` installed, getting the languages setup is as easy as running `$ asdf install` in the repo. Alternatively, install the versions of `erlang` and `elixir` described in this repositories [.tool-versions][tool-versions] file.

### Dev dependencies

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup project dependencies

### Running locally
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
